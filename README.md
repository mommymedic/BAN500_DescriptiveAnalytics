UNCW BAN500 Descriptive Analytics Final Project

This goal of this final project was to independently choose a raw dataset to clean and analyze. 

As EMS was a huge part of my life I decided to use response emergency response data from Tempe, Arizona for the years 2020-2021. 

When looking at the ALS response data for Tempe, AZ in 2020 I want to answer these questions:
1.	Is there a particular time of day that is busiest? Day of week? Week of month?
2.	Does the time-of-day influence response times?
3.	What unit number responds to the most calls? By week and month.
